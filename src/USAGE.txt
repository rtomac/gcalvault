Exports all of a user's Google Calendars to iCal/ICS format for backup (or portability).

Usage:
  gcalvault sync <user> [<cal-ids>...]
  gcalvault sync <user> [<cal-ids>...] --export-only
  gcalvault -h | --help
  gcalvault --version

Options:
  user              Required. Google username/email address,
                    e.g. foo.bar@gmail.com.
  cal-ids           Optional. IDs of specific calendars to export. If provided,
                    exports just the specified calendars. If not provided, all
                    of the user's calendars are discovered and exported
                    (default behavior).
  -e --export-only  Export calendars to output dir only, do not create and
                    manage version history in a vault.
  -i --ignore-role  Access roles to ignore when exporting calendars, which can
                    be one of "owner", "writer", or "reader". Option can be
                    provided multiple times one the command line to ignore
                    multiple. Typical usage would be to export just calendars
                    where user is owner and/or where user has write access.
  -c --conf-dir     Directory where configuration is stored (e.g. access
                    token). Defaults to ~/.gcalvault.
  -o --output-dir --vault-dir
                    Directory to which calendar .ics files are exported
                    and/or stored. Defaults to the current working directory.
  --client-id       Recommended. Custom OAuth2 client ID you've provisioned
                    with Google to use when authorizing user access.
  --client-secret   Client secret for custom client ID provided
                    via --client-id.
  -h --help         Show this help screen.
  --version         Show the program's version.

This program will discover all of a user's calendars (via Google Calendar
API) and export each of them as an .ics file. Alternately, it can be used to
export a subset of specific calendars.

This program's sync function is meant to be used in one of two ways:
- As a simple export utility (via --export-only).
- As a backup utility, with version history for each of the calendars exported
  (default behavior). Version history is stored under the covers in a git
  repository managed by gcalvault.
